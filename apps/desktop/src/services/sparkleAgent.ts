 *  (no PII / no user content in specs or PRs) lives here by design — it is the default.
 *
 *  The persona BRANCHES on the user's consent mode (bead sparkle-4xwk.1) so the agent's actual
 *  behavior matches what the consent banner promises:
 *  - "always":       PRs are submitted automatically once they pass the scrub gate.
 *  - "case_by_case": every PR is drafted, scrubbed, then PRESENTED for explicit approval —
 *                    `gh pr create` never runs without the user saying so in chat.
 *  - "never":        chat-only. The persona carries no log path and no log-review instructions;
 *                    the agent acts only on what the user explicitly reports here.
 *  In every mode that can produce a PR, submission is gated on `scripts/sparkle-scrub.sh`
 *  (the PII/secret linter at the repo root) exiting 0. */
